Overview
========

`Open_street_map`_ is a repository of ROS_ packages for working with
`Open Street Map`_ information.

**Warning**::

  The master branch normally contains code being tested for the next
  ROS release.  It will not always work with all previous releases.
  Sometimes, it may not work at all.

The current master works with Hydro and Indigo.  To build for Fuerte
or Groovy, check out the rosbuild branch instead of master.
